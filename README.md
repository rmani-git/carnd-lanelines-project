In this project we will detect lane lines in images using Python and OpenCV. Implemented using Jupyter Notebook

We will use road images from 3 test videos as input stream and detect the lanes, anotate the lane lines with a solid line and return
annotated video stream as output

1. Jupyter Notebook is P1.ipynb
2. Input video stream: 3 videos under test_videos
3. Annotated output video: test_videos_output
